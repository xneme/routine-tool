# Phase 1.1: UI Refinements Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Polish visual hierarchy and task card presentation based on user feedback
**Verified:** 2026-01-29T18:24:57Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No - initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Task cards are visually distinct from each other (not appearing as one block) | VERIFIED | `TaskCard.kt:73-78`: Uses `ElevatedCard` with `CardDefaults.cardElevation(defaultElevation = 2.dp)` providing shadow separation |
| 2 | Collapsed tasks have reduced vertical spacing for better density | VERIFIED | `TaskListScreen.kt:65`: `verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp)` provides consistent 8dp spacing between cards |
| 3 | Sections (Overdue, Active, Done) are clearly separated visually | VERIFIED | `TaskListScreen.kt:97-101, 136-140`: `HorizontalDivider` with `outlineVariant` color between sections |
| 4 | Active tasks section has a header like other sections | VERIFIED | `TaskListScreen.kt:110`: `text = "Tasks"` header for active section with `titleMedium` style |
| 5 | Checkbox positioned on right side under deadline icons | VERIFIED | `TaskCard.kt:103`: `Column(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.End)` containing deadline badge and checkbox |
| 6 | Icons have appropriate color coding (not monochrome) | VERIFIED | `DeadlineBadge.kt:58-61`: soft deadlines use `primary`, hard deadlines use `secondary` |
| 7 | Overdue tasks have subtle red tint for differentiation | VERIFIED | `TaskCard.kt:68`: `Color(0xFFE53935).copy(alpha = 0.08f).compositeOver(surfaceColor)` |
| 8 | Done tasks have subtle green tint for differentiation | VERIFIED | `TaskCard.kt:66`: `Color(0xFF4CAF50).copy(alpha = 0.12f).compositeOver(surfaceColor)` |
| 9 | Reschedule options collapsed behind expandable button | VERIFIED | `TaskCard.kt:208-241`: `AnimatedVisibility` with `expandVertically()/shrinkVertically()` for reschedule options |
| 10 | App header removed from top of screen | VERIFIED | No `topBar` parameter in Scaffold, no `TopAppBar` import/usage in TaskListScreen.kt |

**Score:** 10/10 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `app/src/main/java/com/routinetool/ui/components/TaskCard.kt` | ElevatedCard with semantic tinting, repositioned checkbox, collapsible reschedule | VERIFIED | 265 lines, uses ElevatedCard, custom color tints, AnimatedVisibility for reschedule, checkbox in right-aligned Column |
| `app/src/main/java/com/routinetool/ui/screens/tasklist/TaskListScreen.kt` | TaskListScreen without TopAppBar, with section dividers and Tasks header | VERIFIED | 205 lines, no TopAppBar, HorizontalDivider between sections, "Tasks" header at line 110 |
| `app/src/main/java/com/routinetool/ui/components/DeadlineBadge.kt` | Colored icon tints using MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary/secondary | VERIFIED | 71 lines, uses `colorScheme.secondary` for hard deadlines, `colorScheme.primary` for soft deadlines |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| TaskCard.kt | CardDefaults.cardColors | containerColor with custom tints | WIRED | Line 78: `colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(containerColor = containerColor)` |
| TaskCard.kt | AnimatedVisibility | collapsible reschedule options | WIRED | Lines 218-241: AnimatedVisibility wraps reschedule Row |
| TaskListScreen.kt | Scaffold | removed topBar parameter | WIRED | Lines 33-41: Scaffold has only floatingActionButton, no topBar |
| TaskListScreen.kt | HorizontalDivider | section separation | WIRED | Lines 97-101 and 136-140: HorizontalDivider with outlineVariant color |
| DeadlineBadge.kt | Icon tint | primary/secondary colors | WIRED | Lines 58-61: conditional tint based on deadline type |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Supporting Truths |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| UX-01 (refinement) | SATISFIED | Truths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - visual hierarchy improved |
| UX-02 (refinement) | SATISFIED | Truths 7, 8 - semantic tinting for task states without shame-inducing colors |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| TaskCard.kt | 261 | `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")` | Info | Suppresses kotlinx.datetime deprecation warning - acceptable pending library update |

No blocker or warning-level anti-patterns found. The suppression annotation is documented in 01.1-02-SUMMARY.md.

### Human Verification Required

The 01.1-02-SUMMARY.md indicates human verification was already performed with all 10 criteria approved. Key visual behaviors that were human-verified:

1. **Visual card distinction** - Cards have subtle shadows visible on device
2. **Color tints subtlety** - Red/green tints are subtle (8-12% opacity), not harsh
3. **Reschedule expansion animation** - AnimatedVisibility provides smooth expand/collapse
4. **Deadline icon colors** - Primary and secondary colors are visually distinct from monochrome

No additional human verification needed - already completed during plan execution.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 10 success criteria from ROADMAP.md are verified in the codebase:

1. **ElevatedCard with 2.dp elevation** provides visual distinction between task cards
2. **8.dp vertical spacing** via `Arrangement.spacedBy()` provides appropriate density
3. **HorizontalDividers** with conditional logic separate sections cleanly
4. **"Tasks" header** added for active section matching Overdue/Done style
5. **Right-side Column layout** positions checkbox under deadline icons
6. **Primary/secondary icon tints** replace monochrome gray in DeadlineBadge
7. **Custom red tint (8% opacity)** for overdue tasks
8. **Custom green tint (12% opacity)** for done tasks  
9. **AnimatedVisibility** wraps reschedule options with expandVertically/shrinkVertically
10. **No TopAppBar** in Scaffold - removed completely

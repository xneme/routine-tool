# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-foundation-quick-capture
    provides: TaskCard and DeadlineBadge components for task display
provides:
  - ElevatedCard with 2.dp elevation for visual distinction
  - Semantic container colors (errorContainer, tertiaryContainer, surfaceContainerLow)
  - Collapsible reschedule options with AnimatedVisibility
  - Checkbox repositioned to right side
  - Colorized deadline icons (primary/secondary)
affects: [01.1-02, ui-components]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Semantic container colors for task state indication"
    - "AnimatedVisibility for collapsible UI sections"
    - "ElevatedCard with consistent 2.dp elevation"

key-decisions:
  - "ElevatedCard with 2.dp elevation provides subtle shadow distinction"
  - "errorContainer for overdue, tertiaryContainer for done, surfaceContainerLow for active"
  - "Reschedule behind collapsible button to reduce visual noise"
  - "Checkbox moved to right side for cleaner left-aligned title layout"
  - "Deadline icons use primary (soft) and secondary (hard) colors"

patterns-established:
  - "State-based semantic colors: Use MaterialTheme.colorScheme containers for task states"
  - "Text color matching: Use onXxxContainer colors to match containerColor"
  - "Collapsible sections: Use AnimatedVisibility with expandVertically/shrinkVertically"

# Phase 1.1 Plan 01: Card-Level Visual Refinements Summary

**ElevatedCard with semantic tinting (errorContainer/tertiaryContainer/surfaceContainerLow), right-side checkbox, collapsible reschedule, and colorized deadline icons**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min 23 sec
- **Started:** 2026-01-29T13:24:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29T13:26:39Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Task cards now visually distinct with subtle shadows (ElevatedCard with 2.dp elevation)
- Overdue tasks have subtle red-tinted background (errorContainer)
- Completed tasks have subtle green-tinted background (tertiaryContainer)
- Active tasks use surfaceContainerLow for neutral appearance
- Checkbox repositioned to right side under deadline badge
- Reschedule options collapsed behind expandable "Reschedule" button
- Deadline icons now use primary (soft) and secondary (hard) colors

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Enhance TaskCard with elevation, semantic tinting, and checkbox repositioning** - `663ab83` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Colorize DeadlineBadge icons** - `b036690` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/routinetool/ui/components/TaskCard.kt` - ElevatedCard with semantic colors, repositioned checkbox, collapsible reschedule
- `app/src/main/java/com/routinetool/ui/components/DeadlineBadge.kt` - Primary/secondary icon tints

## Decisions Made
- **ElevatedCard elevation:** 2.dp provides subtle shadow without heavy visual weight
- **Container color mapping:** errorContainer (overdue) provides red hint, tertiaryContainer (done) provides green hint without harsh colors
- **Checkbox position:** Right side allows title to be left-aligned and fill available width
- **Reschedule collapse:** Reduces visual clutter for overdue tasks; user expands when ready to act
- **Icon colors:** Primary for soft deadlines, secondary for hard deadlines matches Material 3 semantic meaning

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **Build verification:** JAVA_HOME not available in execution environment; code changes verified via pattern matching. Build verification deferred to human testing.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Card-level visual refinements complete
- Ready for Plan 02: List-level refinements (spacing, section headers, header removal)
- TaskListScreen will need to remove alpha(0.6f) modifier now that tertiaryContainer provides done-state visual distinction
